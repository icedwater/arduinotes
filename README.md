# Arduino Explorations

Working through Coding the Arduino (ISBN 978-1-4842-3509-6) by Bob Dukish.
I dug up an old Arduino Uno R3 that still seems to work fine.

## arduino-mk

I've also installed the Ubuntu [arduino-mk][amk] package so I can build on
the command line with a Makefile, as long as the arduino IDE is installed.

I'd rather use vim exclusively and not have to rely on Java but... :shrug:
